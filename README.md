# renders-add-exact-id
If you are here, and I didn't send you here, then this is not going to make sense.

This is a tool to add exact ids to renders. This is very easy to run.

* Step 1: Download the latest release
* Step 2: Download renders from https://my.chili-publish.com/Reports/TotalRendersPerMonthPerCustomer
* Step 3: Drop the CSV file from step 2 on the EXE from step 1
* Step 4: Console will open, and log in with you my.chili-publish account
* Step 5: The output file will be found in the same folder as the EXE
